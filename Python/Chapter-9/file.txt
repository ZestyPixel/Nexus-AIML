There was once a boy named Harry destined to be a star
His parents were killed by Voldemort, leaving him with a scar
He lived with the Dursleys, who treated him quite ###
Until he got his letter from Hogwarts, which made him very glad
At Hogwarts, he met Ron and Hermione, his loyal friends
Together they faced many dangers, their bravery never ends
They fought against dark wizards, and played Quidditch too
Harry's courage and kindness always shone through
In the end, Harry defeated Voldemort, bringing peace to the land
He became a hero, with a wand in his hand
And so the story of Harry Potter will forever be told

I am appending this line.
